Very short outline of how I calculated overlap between gene lists using Fisher's exact test. This analysis was performed using the package 'GeneOverlap'.

#Load package, load gene lists to compare, perform stats. 
```{r}
library(GeneOverlap)

obj <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Documents/R/ComparativeAnalysis/GeneLists/VennGeneList_Foxg1_Pax6.csv")

go.obj <- newGeneOverlap(obj$Ã¯..Foxg1, obj$Pax6)

go.obj <- testGeneOverlap(go.obj)

print(go.obj)
```
